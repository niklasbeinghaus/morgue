 * Wraps and adapts Sabre webdav client to our use.

 * In that directory we will attempt to create a directory
 * named for the event_id (some number) and images
 * associated with that event will be placed in that directory.
 *
 * Example.  Username: morgue
 *           Event ID: 13
 *           upload file name: a_graph.png
 * will attempt to MKCOL /morgue/13
 * and then PUT our file into /morgue/13/a_graph.png
